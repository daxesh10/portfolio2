                                        Designed a Job portal that gets all the job listing from Linkedin , indeed etc according to post date, it is an automated software that gets all the jobs posting with details of companies such as job requirements, location , logo , job post date etc and linking it with cloud database. It also have feature to separate Easy Apply jobs and Apply to Company jobs making easier for users to Apply jobs. I have used automation script using nightwatch , NodeJS, Selenium-Web-server and other npm modules (NightmareJS, SlimerJs, Loadash and etc.) to make the software  scrape information from different job sites. Have connected framework to firebase database and also gave decent UI to
                                        Job portal. Have also made website responsive using media queries.
